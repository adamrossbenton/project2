HALFPRICE

Days are long, paychecks are short. Halfprice.

So it's 5:00 on a Thursday. You're leaving the office of your underpaid job after a long day of getting chewed out by your overpaid boss. You're too hungry, too sober, and too full of existential angst and ennui.  
And then your coworker invites you to this cool new place for drinks that they found on Halfprice. And that dark grey cloud grows a beautiful silver lining.

HALFPRICE is an app designed to find you the tastiest and cheapest ways to ward off the creeping dread of your corporate overlords overtaking your livelihood. It is a community-sourced repository of all of the best happy hour spots in your area and beyond. With just a fraction of the meaningless clicks you've performed throughout the day at your soulless office job, you can find a spot near you that serves one (or more) of your favorite kinds of food, specially priced for people coming off of a grueling day sitting behind a desk doing 2 hours of work over a span of 9 hours.

Authorized users submit their favorite happy hour spots (via our super handy submissions page) to our database, and these results appear in a cultivated list just for you. And, well, everyone else in your general area.

Some challenges I faced during the coding process:

* I had a lot of traveling/family events over the past week, was sometimes difficult to make time to work on the app
* I have no idea why my mobile view is for ants
* Adding images appears to ignore styling rules for those images
